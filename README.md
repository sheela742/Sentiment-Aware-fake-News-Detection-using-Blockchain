# ðŸ“° Sentiment-Aware Fake News Detection using Blockchain

## ðŸ“Œ Overview
This project presents a **hybrid system** that combines **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** for sentiment-aware fake news classification with **Blockchain Technology** for secure, transparent, and tamper-proof storage.  
It aims to detect emotionally manipulative fake news articles and ensure the integrity and traceability of news content in digital platforms.

## âœ¨ Key Features
- **Sentiment Analysis**: Detects the emotional tone (positive, negative, neutral) in news articles to identify bias or manipulation.
- **Fake News Classification**: Uses machine learning classifiers (e.g., Logistic Regression, Passive-Aggressive) to categorize news as *fake* or *real*.
- **Blockchain Integration**: Stores verified news records on an immutable ledger to prevent tampering and enable traceability.
- **Title-Text Similarity Check**: Ensures consistency between the headline and article body to detect clickbait.
- **Real-Time Processing**: Supports quick classification and storage for timely fake news detection.

## ðŸ›  Tech Stack
**Frontend:**
- HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript

**Backend:**
- Python (Flask Framework)
- SQLite3 (Database)

**Machine Learning & NLP:** 
- NLTK / TextBlob / VADER  
- Logistic Regression, Passive-Aggressive Classifier

**Blockchain:**
- Python-based Blockchain Implementation

**Tools & Platforms:**
- Jupyter Notebook
- Git & GitHub

##  Why This Project?
Fake news is a major threat to **public trust, democracy, and social stability**.  
Most detection systems:
- Lack **emotional context** in classification.
- Do not guarantee **data integrity**.
- Fail to provide **traceability** of news sources.

This project addresses these gaps by:
1. **Adding Sentiment Awareness** to detect manipulative emotional framing.
2. **Using Blockchain** to store verified records, ensuring immutability and transparency.
3. **Combining Machine Learning with Distributed Ledger Technology** for robust, real-time fake news detection.

## ðŸ”® Future Scope
- Integration with **social media APIs** for automatic detection of fake news posts.
- Enhancement of **deep learning models** (e.g., BERT, RoBERTa) for improved accuracy.
- Deployment on **cloud platforms** for scalability.
- Development of a **browser extension** for on-the-spot news credibility checks.
- Advanced **fact-checking mechanisms** using trusted news sources.
